# odin-restaurant-page

A basic mock-up of a fictional restaurant.

Here's the [live project demo](https://tywiththewifi.github.io/odin-restaurant-page/).

About
This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) curriculum. It is the third project required for completion of the JavaScript Course [3/12].

These were the project requirements:

 Build your project using npm and webpack.
 Create the website with very minimal HTML, e.g. by appending each new element to div#content with Javascript once the page is first loaded.
 Use tabbed browsing to access the Contact and Menu pages.
 Write the tab-switching logic inside of index.js. Add event listeners for each button in the header navbar that wipes out the current contents of div#content.

What I Learned:

I learned how to build a website by manipulating the DOM entirely through Javascript. I also learned how to build a basic webpack-powered app and upload it to Github Pages.
